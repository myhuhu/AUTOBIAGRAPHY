    <h1>Childhood</h1>
    <p>I started school at the age of 5 years in a local primary school called Okok primary school. 
        I was a bright student and I was always eager to learn new things at school.
         I consistently performed well in academics, 
         earning top grades and recognition for my achievements. 
         One notable learning experience was when I participated in a science fair 
         and built a working model of a wind turbine. This project taught me the importance
          of research, creativity, and perseverance. I also actively participated in extracurricular 
          activities such as sports,
          drama, and music, which helped me develop teamwork and leadership skills.
